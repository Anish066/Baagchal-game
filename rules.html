            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Baag Chal is a traditional Nepali board game, also known as "Tigers and Goats." It is a two-player strategy game where one player controls four tigers, and the other controls up to 20 goats. The game is played on a 5x5 grid with intersecting lines forming a star-like pattern.</p>

                <li><strong>Goats:</strong> Immobilize all four tigers by surrounding them so they cannot move or jump.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Movement Phase:</strong> After all goats are placed, move one goat to an adjacent empty point along a line.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Capture:</strong> A tiger can jump over a goat to an empty point immediately beyond it along a line, capturing the goat. The captured goat is removed from the board.</li>
